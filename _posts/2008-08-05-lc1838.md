## 1838	Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

array经历k次增加操作，potentially出现最多次数的数字的频率

```java
public int maxFrequency(int[] A, int k) {
        int res = 1, i = 0, j;
        long sum = 0;
        Arrays.sort(A);
        for (j = 0; j < A.length; ++j) {
            sum += A[j];
            while (sum + k < (long)A[j] * (j - i + 1)) {
                sum -= A[i];
                i += 1;
            }
            res = Math.max(res, j - i + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
```

Sort and then maintain a sliding window.

    Sort and traverse the array starting from the 2nd element;
    For each upper bound of the sliding window, compute how many operations needed to make all the elements within the sliding window equal, and deduct it from k;
    If k is not big enough to finish the operations, increase lower bound and change k accordingly.
    After all iterations, the windown width is the solution.
    
```java
public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
    Arrays.sort(nums);
    int lo = 0, hi = 1; // lower and upper bounds of the sliding window.
    while (hi < nums.length) {
        k -= (nums[hi] - nums[hi - 1]) * (hi - lo); // deduct the # of operations needed make all elements in the window equal.
        if (k < 0) {
            k += nums[hi] - nums[lo++];
        }
        ++hi;
    }
    return hi - lo;
}
```
