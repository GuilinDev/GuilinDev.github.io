## 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

Given two integers left and right that represent the range [left, right], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Example 1:

    Input: left = 5, right = 7
    Output: 4

Example 2:

    Input: left = 0, right = 0
    Output: 0

Example 3:

    Input: left = 1, right = 2147483647
    Output: 0
 

Constraints:

    0 <= left <= right <= 231 - 1
    
数字范围按位与

The idea is very simple:

    last bit of (odd number & even number) is 0.
    when m != n, There is at least an odd number and an even number, so the last bit position result is 0.
    Move m and n rigth a position.

Keep doing step 1,2,3 until m equal to n, use a factor to record the iteration time.
```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        if(m == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        int moveFactor = 1;
        while(m != n){
            m >>= 1;
            n >>= 1;
            moveFactor <<= 1;
        }
        return m * moveFactor;
    }
}
```
