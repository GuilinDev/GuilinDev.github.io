## 1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock

[给时针和分针求60单位制的角度 - Math](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/angle-between-hands-of-a-clock/solution/shi-zhong-zhi-zhen-de-jia-jiao-by-leetcode/)

O(1)
```java
class Solution {
  public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
    int oneMinAngle = 6;
    int oneHourAngle = 30;

    double minutesAngle = oneMinAngle * minutes;
    double hourAngle = (hour % 12 + minutes / 60.0) * oneHourAngle;

    double diff = Math.abs(hourAngle - minutesAngle);
    return Math.min(diff, 360 - diff);
  }
}
```
