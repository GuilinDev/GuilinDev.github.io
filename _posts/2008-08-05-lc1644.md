## 1644 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree II $

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the lowest common ancestor \(LCA\) of two given nodes,_ `p` _and_ `q`. If either node `p` or `q` **does not exist** in the tree, return `null`. All values of the nodes in the tree are **unique**.

According to the [**definition of LCA on Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes `p` and `q` in a binary tree `T` is the lowest node that has both `p` and `q` as **descendants** \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\)". A **descendant** of a node `x` is a node `y` that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node.

**Example 1:**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5. A node can be a descendant of itself according to the definition of LCA.
```

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 10
Output: null
Explanation: Node 10 does not exist in the tree, so return null.
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
* `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `p != q`

 **Follow up:** Can you find the LCA traversing the tree, without checking nodes existence?

### 分析

跟236比较，结点自己可以作为自己的后裔。



This question is similar to [236. Last Common Ancestor of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/). Question 236 has two important premises:

1. It is guaranteed that both p and q are in the tree.
2. A node can be a descendant of itself.

In the case of p = 5 and q = 4:  
![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/dc766c41-2167-4066-b6d7-be258702edb3_1605241731.2311096.png)

Because of the premises, we can return either p OR q as soon as we find one of them. Here is the code:

```text
public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
	if (root == p || root == q || root == null) return root;
    TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);     
    TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
    return left == null ? right : right == null ? left : root;
}
```

But for this question, the premises are different:

1. It is NOT guaranteed that both p and q are in the tree.
2. A node can still be a descendant of itself.

Hence,

1. We need a way to record if we've seen both p and q
2. We need to traverse the entire tree even after we've found one of them.

Here are the differences in code. The rest is the same.

1. Use either `boolean` or integers as flags
2. Keep traversing down the entire tree. If you return early, the above example would be null, because the code stops when it finds 5 and does not keep searching for 4.

### 代码

Solution 1: Use 2 booleans

```java
class Solution {
    boolean pFound = false;
    boolean qFound = false;

    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        TreeNode LCA = LCA(root, p, q);
        return pFound && qFound ? LCA : null;
    }
    
    public TreeNode LCA(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null) return root;
        TreeNode left = LCA(root.left, p, q);     
        TreeNode right = LCA(root.right, p, q);
        if (root == p) {
            pFound = true;
            return root;
        }
        if (root == q) {
            qFound = true;
            return root;
        }
        return left == null ? right : right == null ? left : root;
    }
}
```

Solution 2: Use integers

```java
class Solution {
	int count = 0;
	
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        TreeNode LCA = LCA(root, p, q);
        return count == 2 ? LCA : null;
    }
    
    public TreeNode LCA(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null) return root;
        TreeNode left = LCA(root.left, p, q);     
        TreeNode right = LCA(root.right, p, q);
        if (root == p || root == q) {
            count++;
            return root;
        }
        return left == null ? right : right == null ? left : root;
    }
}
```
