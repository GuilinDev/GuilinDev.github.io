## 26 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

### 原题概述

> Given a sorted array _nums_, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only _once_ and return the new length.
>
> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Given nums = [1,1,2],
>
> Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
>
> It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
>
> Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
>
> It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
> ```
>
> **Clarification:**
>
> Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
>
> Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
>
> Internally you can think of this:
>
> ```text
> // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
> int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
>
> // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
> // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
> for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
>     print(nums[i]);
> }
> ```

### 题意和分析

与第27题的解法基本相同，这道题是在一个排好序的Array中，找到有多少个非duplicate的值然后存储在index里，index则在in place的位置上。

Time：O\(n\)。

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
  public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    int slow = 0;//最左边可以swap的位置
    for (int fast = 0; fast <= nums.length - 1; fast++) {
      if (fast < 1 || nums[fast] != nums[slow - 1]) {
        if (slow != fast) { // 优化下，自己与自己不用再赋值赋值,[1,2,3,4,5]这种情况
          nums[slow] = nums[fast];
        }
        slow++;
      }
    }
    return slow;
  }
}
```
