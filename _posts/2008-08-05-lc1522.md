## 1522. Diameter of N-Ary Tree

N-ary树的直径，直径是两个最远的nodes的距离

In this solution, we are exploring all nodes of the input N-Ary Tree using Depth-First Search.

Length of the longest path passing through a node = 1st Max Height among N children + 2nd Max Height among N children + 2

Thus, Diameter of the entire tree = Max(Length of the longest path passing through each node)

Complexity Analysis:

For complexity calculation, let us assume:

N = Maximum number of children of a node. Each node can have 0 to N nodes.

M = Total number of nodes in the input N-Ary Tree.

Time Complexity:

In a Tree, if there are M nodes, then there will be M-1 edges.

In this solution, each node and each edge will be visited once.

Thus, Total Time Complexity = O(V + E) = O(M + M-1) = O(M)

Space Complexity: O(Height of the input tree)

In worst case, for a skewed tree, height can be equal to the total number of nodes. Thus, worst case space complexity = O(M)

In best / average case, for a balanced N-ary tree, height = O(log M / log N) = O(logN M).

```java
class Solution {
    public int diameter(Node root) {
        if (root == null || root.children.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int[] maxD = new int[1];
        dfs(root, maxD);
        return maxD[0];
    }

    private int dfs(Node root, int[] maxD) {
        if (root.children.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Setting below maximums to -1 helps in the case if there is only one child
        // node of this root node.
        int maxHeight1 = -1;
        int maxHeight2 = -1;

        for (Node child : root.children) {
            int childHeight = dfs(child, maxD);
            if (childHeight > maxHeight1) {
                maxHeight2 = maxHeight1;
                maxHeight1 = childHeight;
            } else if (childHeight > maxHeight2) {
                maxHeight2 = childHeight;
            }
        }

        maxD[0] = Math.max(maxD[0], maxHeight1 + maxHeight2 + 2);
        return maxHeight1 + 1;
    }
}
```
