## 860 Lemonade Change

### 题目

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs `$5`. 

Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time \(in the order specified by `bills`\).

Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.

Return `true` if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [5,5,10]
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: [10,10]
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation: 
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.
```

**Note:**

* `0 <= bills.length <= 10000`
* `bills[i]` will be either `5`, `10`, or `20`.

### 分析

只有三种面值，看最后是否能够找钱。使用贪心的思想，如果遇到$5，直接收下；如果遇到$10，找$5；如果遇到$20，有两种选择，找3个$5，或者找1个$5和$10 - 这里考虑贪心，总是先找$10，因为手里有两个$5肯定比一个$10要好。

算法：

收到$5 - five++

收到$10 - five--, ten++

收到$20 - five--, ten-- 或者five -- 三次 if ten ==0

中间检查$5是否为负，时间复杂度O\(n\)，空间复杂度O\(1\)。

### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] bills) {
        int five = 0, ten = 0;
        for (int bill : bills) {
            if (bill == 5) five++;
            else if (bill == 10) {five--; ten++;}
            else if (ten > 0) {ten--; five--;}
            else five -= 3;
            if (five < 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
