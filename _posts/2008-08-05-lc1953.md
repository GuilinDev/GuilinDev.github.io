## 1953. Maximum Number of Weeks for Which You Can Work

There are n projects numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer array milestones where each milestones[i] denotes the number of milestones the ith project has.

You can work on the projects following these two rules:

Every week, you will finish exactly one milestone of one project. You must work every week.
You cannot work on two milestones from the same project for two consecutive weeks.
Once all the milestones of all the projects are finished, or if the only milestones that you can work on will cause you to violate the above rules, you will stop working. Note that you may not be able to finish every project's milestones due to these constraints.

Return the maximum number of weeks you would be able to work on the projects without violating the rules mentioned above.

 

Example 1:

Input: milestones = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: One possible scenario is:
​​​​- During the 1st week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.
- During the 2nd week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.
- During the 3rd week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.
- During the 4th week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.
- During the 5th week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.
- During the 6th week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.
The total number of weeks is 6.
Example 2:

Input: milestones = [5,2,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: One possible scenario is:
- During the 1st week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.
- During the 2nd week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.
- During the 3rd week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.
- During the 4th week, you will work on a milestone of project 1.
- During the 5th week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.
- During the 6th week, you will work on a milestone of project 2.
- During the 7th week, you will work on a milestone of project 0.
The total number of weeks is 7.
Note that you cannot work on the last milestone of project 0 on 8th week because it would violate the rules.
Thus, one milestone in project 0 will remain unfinished.
 

Constraints:

    n == milestones.length
    1 <= n <= 105
    1 <= milestones[i] <= 109
    
给你 n 个项目，编号从 0 到 n - 1 。同时给你一个整数数组 milestones ，其中每个 milestones[i] 表示第 i 个项目中的阶段任务数量。

你可以按下面两个规则参与项目中的工作：

每周，你将会完成 某一个 项目中的 恰好一个 阶段任务。你每周都 必须 工作。
在 连续的 两周中，你 不能 参与并完成同一个项目中的两个阶段任务。
一旦所有项目中的全部阶段任务都完成，或者仅剩余一个阶段任务都会导致你违反上面的规则，那么你将 停止工作 。注意，由于这些条件的限制，你可能无法完成所有阶段任务。

返回在不违反上面规则的情况下你 最多 能工作多少周。
