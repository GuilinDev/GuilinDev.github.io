## 180 Consecutive Numbers

Table: `Logs`

```text
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
```

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```text
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+

Result table:
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
```

### Schema

```sql
Create table If Not Exists Logs (Id int, Num int)
Truncate table Logs
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('1', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('2', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('3', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('4', '2')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('5', '1')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('6', '2')
insert into Logs (Id, Num) values ('7', '2')
```

### Solution

hard coding

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT T.Num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM
(SELECT DISTINCT A.Num FROM
Logs A
LEFT JOIN Logs B on A.Id = B.Id-1
LEFT JOIN Logs C on A.Id = C.Id-2
WHERE A.Num = B.Num AND A.Num = C.Num) T
```

any number

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select distinct num as consecutiveNums
from (select num,sum(c) over (order by id) as flag from (select id, num, case when LAG(Num) OVER (order by id)- Num = 0 then 0 else 1 end as c
    from logs) a) b
group by num,flag
having count(*) >=3
```
