## 1721	Swapping Nodes in a Linked List

给一个k，左右两端的距离ends为k的两个nodes进行swap

    Put slow at head, and put fast k-1 nodes after slow.
    first = fast.
    If fast isn't already at the last node, move slow and fast one node further until fast.next == null
    second = slow
    Swap the values of first and second
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapNodes(ListNode head, int k) {		
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode first = head, second = head;
        
		// Put fast (k-1) nodes after slow
        for(int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i)
            fast = fast.next;
            
		// Save the node for swapping
        first = fast;

		// Move until the end of the list
        while(fast.next != null) {
			slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        
        // Save the second node for swapping
		// Note that the pointer second isn't necessary: we could use slow for swapping as well
		// However, having second improves readability
        second = slow;
		
		// Swap values
        int temp = first.val;
        first.val = second.val;
        second.val = temp;
        
        return head;
    }
}
```
