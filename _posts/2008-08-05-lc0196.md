## 196 Delete Duplicate Emails

Write a SQL query to **delete** all duplicate email entries in a table named `Person`, keeping only unique emails based on its smallest **Id**.

```text
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
```

For example, after running your query, the above `Person` table should have the following rows:

```text
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
```

**Note:**

Your output is the whole `Person` table after executing your sql. Use `delete` statement.

### Schema

```sql
Truncate table Person
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('1', 'john@example.com')
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('2', 'bob@example.com')
insert into Person (Id, Email) values ('3', 'john@example.com')
```

### Solution

找到出现次数为1的emails，剩下的删掉

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
Delete from Person Where Id not in (
    Select tmp.Id from (
        Select min(Id) as Id 
        from Person 
            Group By email
    ) tmp
)
```
