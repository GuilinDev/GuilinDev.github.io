## 1038 Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree

### 题目 

Given the root of a binary **search** tree with distinct values, modify it so that every `node` has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to `node.val`.

As a reminder, a _binary search tree_ is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/02/tree.png)

```text
Input: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
```

**Constraints:**

1. The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `100`.
2. Each node will have value between `0` and `100`.
3. The given tree is a binary search tree.

**Note:** This question is the same as 538: [https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/)

### 分析 

与538完全一样。

### 代码

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode bstToGst(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root, 0);
        return root;
    }
    private int dfs(TreeNode node, int sum) {
        if (node == null) {
            return sum;
        }
        int right = dfs(node.right, sum); // 先计算当前节点左子树的sum
        int left = dfs(node.left, node.val + right); // 递归右子树的值
        
        node.val += right; //当前节点需要加上右子树的值
        
        return left; // 最后遍历的地方
    }
}
```
